# Assesment

FINAL ASSESSMENT CYNTHIA BELLO

My team roles
•	Part I (Triangle): in charge of the creation and training of the model for its implementation in the industry.
Contribution: Through the general analysis of the preliminary data that we had, it was determined that the decision tree model should be used and the data was modeled, the results obtained provided us with a clear vision.
personal challenge: Make the decision to make the data model to use and remove the fear of not achieving it.

•	Part II(Triangle):  charge of the creation of a workable database.
Contribution: We made the decision in the team that we should create a database in AWS that was accessible to any of the team and related to postgres SQL, through this programming it is possible that the data can be manipulated in the tables defined in PGAdmin
personal challenge: Carrying out the database alone in AWS and creating the tables in PGAdmin, it was a challenge to relate the tables without having any omissions

•	Part III (X): "Tester of All Things" in charge of the final code testing.
Contribution: Carrying out the corresponding tests of this segment, I modeled the information in Radom forest and the result surprised us since the accuracy obtained was 78% while with the previous model it was less than 70%.
personal challenge: My best contribution was in this segment, because I decided to model the data with another model, which was a great help because it gave us a better accuracy of the model.

•	Part IV(Triangle): help to  charge of inal touches and host of dashboard
Contribution: During the development of the dashboard, the whole team gave their opinion about the graphs that were more representative of the information, in this last segment I helped make small visual improvements that would allow anyone to have a more simplified image of the data that is represented.
personal challenge: I consider myself a visual person but without creativity, so I had to activate my visual ingenuity to bring improvements to the graphics



TEAM
I felt that it was a very good team chemistry, once we made the decision of the team members we made a group on WhatsApp where we kept in touch 24 hours a day, we contributed ideas as they occurred to us and whenever any member of the team needed help,  we connected those who were available to solve the problem or doubt of the other member of the team.

Summary of Project
-	An analysis of the cows of our project that are in production to determine until when to stop inseminating them so that they are not a bad investment.
-	Random Forest was the best decision for the contribution in data análisis
-	Data analysis is a parallel world, which allows you to make better business decisions modeling the data.
